This chapter is inspired by [Glen Weyl](https://twitter.com/glenweyl) & Eric Posner's book Radical Markets, the Ethereum Movement, and everyone else with a positive desire to improve equality through better economics and political design.

We will discuss "Liberal Radicalism," how to improve democracy with better design, how to include and listen to everyone with a stake and interest in the future of human flourishing through governance. See [radicalxchange.org](https://radicalxchange.org/) for more information.

All are welcome, especially people who are interested in moving us forward, but who may not be technical.

Montreal Chapter of RadicalxChange is organized by [Justin Harris](https://twitter.com/jusharris) and [Shayan Eskandari](https://twitter.com/sbetamc).
