On July 4th, 2019, we had the first meeting of the Montreal Chapter of RadicalxChange.
We started this meetup with a friendly networking session over pizza provided by the RxC MTL organizers with support of those that could provide donations.

The participants were an interesting mix of academics, developers (a few blockchain devs), and others.
Shortly after, we started the presentation by introducing ourselves `RxC MTL`, and how the Montreal chapter was formed.

The discussion started with a focus on key points of the [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com/) book, such as:
* Common Ownership Self-assessed Tax (COST)
* Quadratic Voting (QV)

And a few points on [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin)'s detailed review and comments on the book.

From there we jumped in a summary of the talks from RadicalxChange conference in Detroit in March 2019. These summaries include but are not limited to:
* Vitalik Buterin - Founder of Ethereum
* Zooko Wilcox - Founder of Zcash - On social income
* Baratunde Thurston on A New Tech Manifesto
* Tristan Harris on A New Paradigm for Technology
* Eva Beylin on Blockchain Watchtowers and Surveillance Capitalism
* Alex Tabarrok on Open Borders: How to Double World GDP, End Abject Poverty and Create a More Free and Just World.
And some others.

Here are the slides for this presentation:

During this presentation we had interesting conversations with the participants. Most of the concerns were the typical concerns around these issues:
* These solutions still just favor the rich
* These solutions ignore the human aspect and only use money as a metric of utility

We agree with these concerns but still recognize that change needs to happen. The solutions proposed by Radical Markets are a step in the right direction and worth experimenting on in controlled environment in order to fine-tune the ideas.

We would like to thank all participants for attending our first meetup held in Montreal and look forward to future events with them.
Also we would like to thank Microsoft for allowing us to use their space to hold this meetup.

Here is everything that happened in this meetup in 37 seconds:
