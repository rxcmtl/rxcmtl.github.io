On July 4th, 2019, Montreal Chapter of RadicalxChange begun. We started this meetup by a networking session over Pizza provided by the RxC MTL organizers. 

The participants were an interesting mix of academics, developers (a few blockchain devs) and others.
Shortly after, we started the presentation by introducing ourselves `RxC MTL`, and how the Montreal chapter is formed.

The discussion started with a focus on key points of the [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com/) book, such as:
* Common Ownership Self-assessed Tax (COST)
* Quadratic Voting (QV)
And a few points on [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin) review and comments on the book.

From there we jumped in a summary of the talks from RadicalxChange conference in Detroit in March 2019. These summaries included but not limited to:
* Vitalik Buterin - Founder of Ethereum
* Zooko Wilcox - Founder of Zcash - On social income
* Baratunde Thurston on A New Tech Manifesto
* Tristan Harris on A New Paradigm for Technology
* Eva Beylin on Blockchain Watchtowers and Surveillance Capitalism
* Alex Tabarrok on Open Borders: How to Double World GDP, End Abject Poverty and Create a More Free and Just World.
And some others.

During this presentation we had interesting conversations with the participants. It was all of the typical concerns around these issues:
* These solutions still just favor the rich
* These solutions ignore the human aspect and only use money as a metric of utility
  

We would like to thank all participants attending our first meetup held in Montreal. Also we would like to thank Microsoft for allowing us to use their space to hold this meetup.

Here is everything that happened in this meetup in 37 seconds:
