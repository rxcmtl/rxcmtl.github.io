### Inspiration and thoughtful code-jacking
Inspiration and bits of things listed below are present inside dactl's code:
- [Daktilo](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo) - dactl is based on Daktilo and inherits it's one-column layout.
- [Hydejack](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/) - I've learned a lot about Jekyll when I took apart [@qwtel](https://github.com/qwtel/)'s excellent fork of [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme. I embraced his more partials = everything is easier to edit policy. Hydejack theme gave me an idea on how to create hero images liquid scripting, loading google fonts and using rem's/em's and more.
- [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) - This guy makes awesome themes and writes a lot about Jekyll and it's more obscure use cases on his blog, [Made Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com). Looking through his theme's code - Minimal Mistakes in particular - gave me lot of information about how to build a robust theme and how to make it configurable within `_config.yml`
- [Trophy](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/trophy-jekyll) - Link border slide animation SASS mixin which I slightly modified to be able to easily change the direction of the animation.
- Various blog posts about Jekyll and [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) posts with useful [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) snippets.
